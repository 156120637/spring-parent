# Server addresses.
# Primary address setting.

# Mapping to `naming/jetty/ip:port` in `config/application.yml` of Collector.
# Examples：
# Single collector：SERVERS="127.0.0.1:8080"
# Collector cluster：SERVERS="10.2.45.126:8080,10.2.45.127:7600"
collector.servers=esserver:10800

# Collector agent_gRPC/grpc service addresses.
# Secondary address setting, only effect when "collector.servers" is empty.
# By using this, no discovery mechanism provided. The agent only uses these addresses to uplink data.
# Recommend to use this only when collector cluster IPs are unreachable from agent side. Such as:
#   1. Agent and collector cluster are in different VPC in Cloud.
#   2. Agent uplinks data to collector cluster through Internet.
